# Retrevial Augmented Generation (RAG)

## Introduction
This sub directory of the GenAI Repository, is to talk and do all things RAG! Furthermore, to track any workings / projects all in one space.

## What is RAG? 
RAG Stands for Retrieval Augmented Generation. Essentially RAG aims to solve potential problems with Large Language Models (LLM's). these problems can be broken down into as follows:
- Hallucination: The concept where a LLM can provide incorrect or misleading information when responding to a query from a user, even when potentially the response returned could appear a warranted response to the untrained eye. This is particulary problematic when the dicussions used against the model relate to medical intervention, investing, academic purposes. 

- Enrich Model knowledge: LLM's have absolutely revolutionised the area of AI and Data Science as we know it. However, some or most of these LLM's are only trained up to the production of the LLM. Therefore, any new events or data that has been created since the LLM creation, will mean that the LLM either cannot respond to it, provide erroneous information, orr complete conjecture.

- Well to get proof on where the LLM got its information from: As well as the above two points, RAG can provide additional trust and efficacy between the user and the LLM , with the ability to track where the LLM has got its information from , to provide you with a response and provide evidence on the information used.
