# Generative AI (GenAI)
Welcome! This repository has been set up for me to learn , understand and apply my knowledge within Generative AI. This provides an opportunity to log the research, experimentation and applications of any areas in this domain with practical example I aim to use in future knowledge sharing and uses. I aim to break down this repo into subsections covering different areas such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Stable Diffusion (Image generation) and so forth.
