# Generative AI (GenAI)
## Introduction
Welcome! This repository has been set up for me to learn, understand and apply my knowledge within Generative AI. This provides an opportunity to log the research, experimentation and applications of any areas in this domain with practical example I aim to use in future knowledge sharing and uses. I aim to break down this repo into subsections covering different areas.
